# 📊 Analysis of Consumer Expectations and Actual Consumption

This project focuses on analyzing consumer expectations in relation to actual consumption. By comparing these data sets, we can gain insights into consumer behavior and economic trends.

## 🚀 Introduction

This script performs the following steps:

- Loads data from a CSV file containing actual consumption data.
- Transforms the data to create meaningful analyses.
- Calculates quarterly averages for consumer expectations.

## 📁 Contents

- **faktiske_forbrug.R**: The R script for analysis, which includes all necessary operations.
- **faktiske_forbrug.csv**: Data file containing actual consumption data.
- **forventning.csv**: Data file containing expected consumption data.

## 📊 Data Analysis

The script performs the following:

### Loading Data:

- Sets the working directory to the specified folder.
- Loads data from `faktiske_forbrug.csv` with specified delimiters and skips the first two rows.

### Data Transformation:

- Creates a data frame from the loaded data and sets row indices.
- Prepares consumer expectations by transposing the data.
- Removes unnecessary rows to refine the data set.

### Quarterly Averages:

- Calculates quarterly averages by grouping the data and taking the mean.
- Names the new rows according to year and quarter.

### Rounding Data:

- Rounds the calculated averages to two decimal places for precision and readability.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **R**: The analysis environment used for data handling and visualization.
- **readr**: Package used for reading data from CSV files.

## 📌 Requirements

- R and RStudio must be installed on your machine.
- The `readr` package should be installed. You can install it by running:

    ```r
    install.packages("readr")
    ```
